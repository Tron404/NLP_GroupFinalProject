# NLP_GroupFinalProject

Use `requirements.txt` to get all of the necessary libraries to run the model. You can use `pip install -r requirements.txt` to do so.

There is also the option of using an anaconda virtual environment. For this, you have to use `conda` commands with the file `requirements_conda.yml` as follows:

```bash
conda env create -f requirements_conda.yml
```

and to activate the new environment:

```bash
conda activate NLP_tfa
```
